# Mark IT - TD Elevate Hackathon Project

Deployed our TD Elevate hackathon website at this link: ec2-18-220-118-99.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

We targeted the first problem statement: Smart Economy: What innovations and technologies will define the future smart economy? How will local businesses and consumers engage in relevant and meaningful interactions that promote local commerce?
 
We mined data of a million virtual customers that TD gave us on Davinci platform and categorized it using a clustering algorithm. We then came up with the best regions a small business owner can market their product at/open a new branch and this can potentially be integrated with TD to provide special discounts/ airmiles to personal account customers of TD if they visit these small businesses to buy products.
 
We can use their location to send them suggestions through the TD app. Thus, creating a win-win-win for all, businesses, account holders and TD.

Steps to use the website:
 
Use the filter on the top left side to set the demographics you want to target and then zoom in and zoom out, it will show you the best regions to market your product (Coffee and fastfood in this case). Overlapping purple regions mean a better probability of marketing, legend on the top right.
 
And then when you click twice on any part of the map, you can see the graph on the right changing, showing the volume of sales in that area and you can switch to the demographics tab as well, on top of the graph and see the gender you want to target your advertisement to.
